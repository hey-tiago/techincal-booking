# Backend

This backend application is built using FastAPI and Tortoise ORM with SQLite. It manages technician bookings by allowing users to list, retrieve, delete, and schedule appointments. Additionally, it includes a natural language “chat” endpoint to process booking instructions from the console.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:hey-tiago/techincal-booking.git
cd techincal-booking
```

2. Run the setup script:

```
chmod +x dev.sh
./dev.sh
```

3. Access the backend at: http://localhost:8000
